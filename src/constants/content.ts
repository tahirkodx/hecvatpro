          Hey, I’m Dave Clarkson, a cybersecurity pro with over <strong>25+ years of experience</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          I’ve advised global banks, government agencies, and payment companies. But I find
          <strong>working with small to medium businesses more fulfilling</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Increasingly, small businesses must comply with <strong>complex customer security mandates</strong>.
          General IT staff rarely have the specialized skills to effectively respond. This fails procurement tests and <strong>delays your sales cycle</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The HECVAT is a perfect example. A quality HECVAT response is <strong>key to selling to the US Education market</strong>. It’s a gateway to procurement.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The HECVAT asks probing questions to identify risks in vendor security programs. You need <strong>expert guidance</strong> for a successful HECVAT. But your budget may be limited…
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          That’s where I come in. I’ve developed a <strong>streamlined process</strong> with custom tools and automations. So I can <strong>guarantee the best results within your budget</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          I’ve helped dozens of companies like yours <strong>pass the HECVAT</strong>. They’ve unlocked new sales opportunities in the US Education market. And I can do the same for you.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Imagine the relief of having a <strong>cybersecurity expert</strong> on your side. Someone who understands the HECVAT inside and out. And who can guide you through the process step-by-step.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          That’s the <strong>peace of mind</strong> I offer. So you can focus on growing your business, not worrying about security mandates.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Ready to take the first step? Schedule a <strong>free consultation</strong> with me today. I’ll review your current security posture and provide a <strong>roadmap to HECVAT success</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Don’t let the HECVAT stand in the way of your growth. Let me help you <strong>unlock the US Education market</strong> and take your business to the next level.
        </p>
