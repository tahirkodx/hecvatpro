As we approach 2024, higher education institutions face a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. With the increasing reliance on technology and the growing sophistication of cyber threats, it is crucial for these institutions to have robust cybersecurity policies in place.

## Understanding the HECVAT
The Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Tool (HECVAT) is a standardized questionnaire designed to assess the cybersecurity risks associated with third-party vendors. It plays a crucial role in helping higher education institutions evaluate and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. By understanding the HECVAT and its implications, institutions can better protect their sensitive data and systems.

## HECVAT Compliance for Vendors
Vendors working with higher education institutions must prioritize HECVAT compliance to ensure the security of their products and services. In 2024, the expectations for vendor compliance will be higher than ever before.
